	    10 + 11 = 21 But as the loop runs this turns into a cummlative cycle of: 10+11 = 21+25 = 46+3C = 82+3C = BE+3C = FA +3C =....=226
	1->	T0S1L2 + T0S1L3, secondary at L1
	    12 + 13 = 25  But as the loop runs this will turn into 29 + 13 = 3C

	1-> T0S2L2 * T0S2L3, secondary at L1
		102 * 103 = 10506	But after the 1st iteration this will change into 10506*103 = 10C2F3C
